# Oject_Detection_YoloV4-
## Data Overview

It's Fruits Images dataset which has Three class like-Apple,Banana,Orange and Each class has around 300 Images.I have done this project using YoloV4 model It's giving me very accurate prediction. Data Source:-[Click Here to Download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbkinaci/fruit-images-for-object-detection).

## Library and Tools

* Python
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Open-Cv
* Pre-trained Models
* Streamlit
* Google Colab
* Visual Studio
* YOLOV4

* Note:- For Training this Dataset I have done transfer learning for that I have used YOLOV4 Model.

## Model Deployment

* For Deployement I used streamlit and I've followed such steps:-
* Create a Folder
* make a file named requirements.txt and put all the required library inside it.
* Create a Virtual Environment inside this folder Follow these Steps -
* Open your command prompt in VS Code and write this command (python -m venv VE_name) and hit enter.
* After that you need to activate this virtual environment for that write this command (VE_name\Scripts\activate) and hit enter.
* You've Activated your virtual environment and you need to install all your required library for creating this app.
* Then Create a python file and write code for streamlit app
* Fro executing this code run this command in command prompt (streamlit run python_file_name.py)
